{"index":11,"name":"prunus-armeniaca","display":"Prunus armeniaca","definition":"Prunus armeniaca , the most commonly cultivated apricot species, also called ansu apricot, Siberian apricot, Tibetan apricot, is a species of Prunus, classified with the plum in the subgenus Prunus.","description":"<p>Apricot, Prunus armeniaca is a deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruit.</p><p>The apricot tree is has an erect growth habit and a spreading canopy.</p><p>The leaves of the tree are ovate with a rounded base, pointed tip and serrated margin.</p><p>The tree produces white to pink flowers, singly or in pairs, and a fleshy yellow to orange fruit.</p><p>The apricot fruit is a drupe with skin that can be smooth or covered in tiny hairs depending on the variety and a single seed enclosed within a protective outer shell (stone).</p><p>Apricot trees can reach 8–12 m (26–39 ft) and can live anywhere between 20 and 40 years depending on variety and growth conditions.</p><p>Apricots may have as many as three centers of origin in China, Central Asia and the Near East.</p><p>Apricots can be consumed fresh or dried.</p><p>They may also be processed into jams and jellies, syrup or juice.</p><p>Apricots have a high genetic variability and as a result, they also have a wide range of growing conditions.</p><p>The trees tend to bloom early compared with other stone fruits and  are therefore susceptible to damage from late frosts.</p><p>Apricots will grow best in deep, well-draining soils and will not tolerate water saturating.</p><p>Apricots have a chilling requirement (period of cold required to break dormancy) of between 250 and 1200 hours below 7°C (45°F) depending on the variety.</p><p>In addition, most apricot  trees do not require a second variety for cross-pollination.</p><p>Apricot trees are usually propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent.</p><p>Trees can be  propagated from cuttings or by budding and grafting.</p><p>Cuttings are lengths of stem usually taken from the previous years growth of an established tree.</p><p>Cuttings  are taken in late winter or early spring and rooted so that they produce a whole new tree.</p><p>Budding and grafting involves joining two genetically distinct plants one is used for the lower part called the rootstock and another is used for the upper part, known as the scion.</p><p>The scion is attached by inserting a bud from the desired variety under the bark of the rootstock so that it produces a new tree.</p><p>Apricot trees should be planted in full sun.</p><p>In colder regions it is beneficial to plant them close to a north facing wall which helps reduce the speed with which the trees warm in the spring, delaying bloom.</p><p>Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole  which is  slightly wider than the root ball.</p><p>Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth.</p><p>It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark.</p><p>If planting multiple trees, space them at least 7.6 m (25 ft) apart.</p><p>Apricots should be pruned annually and are generally trained to an open center.</p><p>Annual pruning encourages new fruit spurs.</p><p>When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to leave 3 or 4 per cluster.</p><p>This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year.</p><p>Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development.</p><p>During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days.</p><p>Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy.</p><p>Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring.</p><p>Prunus armeniaca (meaning Armenian plum), the most commonly cultivated apricot species, also called ansu apricot, Siberian apricot, Tibetan apricot, is a species of Prunus, classified with the plum in the subgenus Prunus.</p><p>The native range is somewhat uncertain due to its extensive prehistoric cultivation, though almost certainly somewhere in Asia.</p><p>It is extensively cultivated in many countries and has escaped into the wild in many places.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/prunus-armeniaca/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/fruits/prunus-armeniaca/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/prunus-armeniaca/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/fruits/prunus-armeniaca/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-03-31T07:50:40Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Plantae"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Rosales"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Rosaceae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Prunus"},{"name":"subgenus","display":"Subgenus","value":"Prunus
