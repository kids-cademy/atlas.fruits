{"index":7,"name":"cherry","display":"Cherry","definition":"A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).","description":"<p>Cherry is a perennial tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its fruit, the cherry.</p><p>Cherry trees have alternating simple oval leaves which often have serrated margins and approximately eight pairs of veins, 5 to 13 centimeters long.</p><p>The flowers are white and appear in clusters of about 3 to 5.</p><p>They appear in early spring and are about one inch long.</p><p>The fruit is dark red, about half an inch to a full inch, matures in early to mid summer.</p><p>The bark is gray-brown, smooth and glossy and it often peels.</p><p>Cherry trees can live up to 60 years, growing to a height of over 15 meters.</p><p>Cherry may also be referred to as sweet cherry, gean, mazzard or wild cherry and originates from the Caspian-Black Sea region and Asia.</p><p>Sour cherry, Prunus cerasus, is closely related to Prunus avium but with fruit that is more acidic.</p><p>The tree has twiggy branches with bright red to near black cherries.</p><p>The tree reaches a height of 4 to 10 m and is believed to have originated as a natural hybrid of wild cherry.</p><p>Cherries are mainly consumed as a fresh fruit or processed into jellies and juices.</p><p>The wood of the cherry tree is a distinctive honey color and is used in furniture making and for musical instruments.</p><p>Sour cherries are used mainly for canning and processing.</p><p>Cherries grow optimally in mild, dry climates and also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy so require cold winters.</p><p>Because of the cold weather requirement, none of the cherries species, can grow in tropical climates.</p><p>Planting on a gentle slope is beneficial for cherry as cold air can drain away from the trees to lower areas, helping to prevent damage.</p><p>Sweet cherries bloom earlier than sour cherries and can be susceptible to damage from late frosts.</p><p>Cherry nurseries are mainly propagated by budding and grafting onto 1 to 2 year old seedling grown from seed.</p><p>In order to grow from seed, pits should be planted in the fall (after first being chilled) and seedlings will emerge in the spring.</p><p>A cherry tree will take three-four years to produce its first crop of fruit and seven years to attain full maturity.</p><p>Cherry trees should be planted in the Spring when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed.</p><p>If bare root plants have been purchased, be sure to keep the root ball moist prior to planting.</p><p>The tree should be planted in a hole which is large enough to accommodate the root ball without bending any of the roots.</p><p>Broken or damaged roots can be removed but try to avoid pruning the roots.</p><p>Place the tree in the planting hole and carefully backfill with soil.</p><p>The tree should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery.</p><p>Carefully firm or tamp the soil to prevent air pockets and when the planting hole is about 2/3 filled, water the roots thoroughly before filling the remainder of the hole with top soil.</p><p>The tree should be watered as needed throughout the first year of growth.</p><p>The area around the base of the tree should be kept free from weeds either by cultivating or using a chemical weed control.</p><p>In the home garden, trees are usually surrounded by turf with only a small area of soil around the trunk which is easy to keep weed free by hand.</p><p>Unless grown in fertile soils, cherry trees may require the addition of some nitrogen fertilizer, the volume of which will vary with the age of the tree.</p><p>The fertilizer should be applied in a band around the trunk of the tree.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/cherry/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/fruits/cherry/contextual.jpg","caption":"<p>Cherry trees will grow in a variety of soils
