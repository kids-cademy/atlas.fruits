{"index":5,"name":"theobroma-cacao","display":"Cacao","definition":"Theobroma cacao is a small evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Mesoamerica.","description":"<p>, is an evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, grown for its seeds (beans) which are used primarily in the manufacture of chocolate.</p><p>The cocoa plant is a branching tree with with simple, pointed (lanceolate) leaves which can measure up to 61 cm (24 in) long and 10 cm (4 in) wide.</p><p>The tree produces clusters of pale yellow flowers each with five petals and sepals.</p><p>The cocoa pods (drupes) can be green-white, yellow, purplish or red in color each of which contains 20–50 seeds, usually arranged in five distinct rows.</p><p>The cocoa tree can reach 4–20 m (13-66 ft) in height and can live for up to 40 years although the commercial life of a cocoa tree is usually about 25 years.</p><p>Cocoa may also be referred to as cacao, koko or Kacao and originates from upper Amazon region of South America.</p><p>Cocoa beans are primarily used in the production of chocolate, cocoa powder and cocoa butter for consumption.</p><p>Cocoa butter is also used in the cosmetic industry.</p><p>Cocoa trees are tropical plants and grow best in humid conditions at temperatures between 18 and 32°C (65–90°F).</p><p>It is typically grown in regions where daytime humidity reaches up to 100% and night time humidity is between 70 and 80%.</p><p>The plants require a deep, fertile and well-draining soil with a pH of 5.0–7.5 for optimum development.</p><p>Cocoa is usually grown in tropical lowland areas is sensitive to drought.</p><p>It should typically not be grown in regions which experience less than 1 cm of rainfall for periods in excess of 3 months.</p><p>Cocoa seeds from healthy, ripe pods remain viable for 3 weeks and are usually planted straight after harvest to produce new seedlings.</p><p>Seeds should be planted in a fiber basket or plastic nursery bag filled with clean soil and placed in a shaded place protected from the sun to prevent scorching.</p><p>Seedlings grow quickly and are ready to be transplanted after 4–6 months.</p><p>Cocoa can also be vegetatively propagated via cuttings, marcotting and budding.</p><p>Cuttings should have 2–5 leaves and 1 or 2 buds.</p><p>Leaves should be cut in half before placing the cutting in a pot and covering with polyethylene to allow roots to develop.</p><p>Marcotting, is achieved by removing a strip of bark from a tree branch and covering the area with a layer of sawdust before covering it with polyethylene.</p><p>The covered area will develop roots and can then be removed and planted.</p><p>The final method, called budding, can be used to rejuvenate older plantings and  involves excising a bud and positioning it under a flap of bark on another tree.</p><p>The join is then sealed with raffia and waxed tape.</p><p>Once the bud begins to grow the tree above the new growth should be removed.</p><p>Seedlings are usually planted in the ground when they are 4–6 months old.</p><p>The young trees are delicate and require some protection from strong sunlight and wind damage.</p><p>Protection is usually provided by planting seedlings next to mother trees.</p><p>This shading also helps to prevent the trees from growing too tall, keeping them at a manageable size for maintenance and harvest.</p><p>Shade trees are usually other crops such as banana, plantain coconut or rubber.</p><p>Cocoa seedlings should be planted 3–4 m (10–13 ft)  apart and 3–6 m (10–20 ft) from the shade trees.</p><p>The shading can be reduced once the cocoa trees have formed a closed canopy but some should be retained to reduce water stress and insect damage.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/theobroma-cacao/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/fruits/theobroma-cacao/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/theobroma-cacao/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/fruits/theobroma-cacao/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-03-31T17:10:05Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Plantae"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Malvales"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Malvaceae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Theobroma"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Cacao"}],"aliases":["Cocoa"],"spreading":[],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":null,"sampleTitle":null,"samplePath":null,"waveformPath":"atlas/theobroma-cacao/page-form-audio-assets_waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/fruits/theobroma-cacao/page-form-audio-assets_waveform.png","facts":[],"features":[{"name":"nutrient.energy","value":228.0,"maximum":null,"quantity":"FOOD_ENERGY","nameDisplay":"Food
